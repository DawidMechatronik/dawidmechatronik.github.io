    <h1>Air rifle powered by CO2 12g cartridge</h1>
    <p>
      Let's consider an air rifle powered by a CO2 12g cartridge. The main difference between a cartridge and an external CO2 tank is 
      the possibility to remove CO2 cartridge piercer which limits the gas flow a lot. Small CO2 tank also have worse temperature stability 
      than bigger CO2 tank. If you shoot fast and the tank has no time to heat up from the environment it is getting colder. Colder tank means 
      less pressure inside the cartridge so air rifle power is decreasing while shooting. After a couple magazines when whole liquid CO2 is vaporized 
      pressure is decreasing rapidly. So those are the main disadvantages of small CO2 cartridges. Luckily, they don't need any investment and work out 
      of the box. You can keep a couple spare 12g cartridges inside your pocket because they are small.

      <b>Tl;tr:</b>With an air rifle powered by a 12g CO2 cartridge you can increase power by 2-10% in a temperature range from 10 to 30&#x2103;. 
      <br>To increase it more (42-48%) you need to use a bulk fill adapter and external CO2 tank (scroll to the page end).

    <h1>1. Stronger hammer spring</h1>
    <p>
      I added various spacers (4, 8 and 12mm) to the factory spring. Bigger spring preload makes the hammer strike valve harder. 
      How about power increase? Let's see the chart:

    <ul class="mylist">
      <li>In temperature range 10-20&#x2103;: Factory spring works the best without spacer.</li>
      <br><li>In temperature range 20-25&#x2103;: All spacers work similarly according to power criteria.</li>
      <br><li>In temperature range 25-30&#x2103;: 12mm spacer gives a 5,5% power increment. The 4mm and 8mm spacer gives about a 4% power increment. </li>
    </ul>

  <div class = "centeredtext">  
    <p>
      <b>
        Summary: factory spring is not bad. Stronger hammer spring makes the air rifle harder to reload, air rifle kicks harder (accuracy may decrease), 
        and trigger is harder to operate. Definitely there is no need for a harder hammer spring. You can try to add small spacer during hot day. 
        After all, there are more disadvantages than advantages, I'm not recommending this mod for CO2 air rifle.

    <h1>2. Weaker valve return spring</h1>
    <p>
      I tested various valve return springs (medium, soft, super soft) instead of factory valve return spring. 
      With a weaker valve spring it is easier to open the valve, the valve stays open for more time because the weaker valve 
      spring pushes the hammer back with smaller force. How about power increase? Let's see the chart:

  <div class = "centeredtext">
    <p>
      <b>
        Summary: good choice for tuning, gives extra power in all temperatures. It sounds like a much better upgrade than stronger 
        hammer spring, because it doesn't influence on trigger action, air rifle reloading force or kicking during shooting.

    <h1>3. Transfer port size </h1>
    <p>
      As far as I know in a couple countries this air rifle is equipped with a 2,5mm transfer port and in fact it can restrict the power a little.
      <br>Keep in mind that the transfer port is only one part, there are two more: barrel port and valve port. To achieve full power gain 
      you should drill the barrel port and valve port to a bigger size.
      <br>Making the barrel port hole too big may damage pellet during loading, or even pellet may partially fall into port and block there. 
      Some people say you shouldn't drill it more than 3,8mm for 4,5mm caliber. 
      During drilling you can also damage the barrel and valve, drill press is recommended.
      <br><br>I plan some more tests with "factory" air rifle so my barrel and valve ports are factory size, about 3,5mm. 
      I tested various transfer port sizes (port diameter 2,5mm; 3,0mm and 4,0mm) instead of the 3,5mm factory transfer port. 
      Bigger transfer port restricts gas flow less, so bigger is better. How about power increase? Let's see the chart:
    </p>    
  </div>
  <img class="photo70" src="Factory CP2 CO2 vs transfer port size.png" alt="Chart factory Artemis CP2 CO2 vs transfer port size">
  <div class = "centeredlist"> 
    <ul class="mylist">
    <li>In temperature range 10-30&#x2103;: When you change a 2,5mm transfer port to a bigger one you will gain about 4% extra power. 
      <br>When you change it from 3,5mm to 4mm without drilling barrel port and valve port it gives much smaller power gain, mostly during hot days.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div class = "centeredtext">
    <p>
      <b>
        Good choice for tuning when your rifle uses a 2,5mm transfer port. When you already have a 3,5mm transfer port it gives very little profit. 
        No disadvantages in air rifle handling. After drilling the barrel port and valve there should be bigger power improvement.

    <h1>4. Single upgrades comparison</h1>
    <p>
      Now you know how single upgrade works, below you can see a comparison between single upgrades to see which one gives the biggest power gain:
    </p>    
  </div>
  <img class="photo70" src="Factory CP2 CO2 vs single upgrade.png" alt="Chart factory Artemis CP2 CO2 vs various upgrades">
  <div class = "centeredtext">
    <p>
      As you see the best single upgrade is a super soft valve return spring. Second one is a 4mm transfer port which gives little boost even with the 
      stock barrel and valve (after drilling the barrel/valve it should work better). Those upgrades have no disadvantages in air gun handling. 
      On the last place is a hammer spring spacer which gives a little extra power during hot days, but also restricts some power during cold days.
    </p> 
  </div>


  <div class = "centeredtext">
    <h1>5. Multi upgrades comparison</h1>
    <p>
      Below you can see comparison between multi upgrades to see which combination gives the best results:
    </p>
  </div>
  <img class="photo70" src="Factory CP2 CO2 vs multi upgrade.png" alt="Chart factory Artemis CP2 CO2 vs various upgrades">
  <div class = "centeredtext">
    <p>
      Those results are a little confusing. As you see you can't add two upgrades together and expect double power gain from those upgrades. 
      <b>While upgrading air gun powered by CO2 cartridge you achieve the best result while replacing valve return spring only.</b>
      Replacing more parts like: transfer port (without drilling barrel/valve!), adding stronger hammer spring or adding spacer to factory spring 
      gives nothing more after replacing valve return spring to super soft one. 
    </p>

  <div class = "centeredtext">
    <h1>6. Need more power?</h1>
    <p>
      You can't do more with an air rifle powered by a CO2 12g capsule. To make it more powerful you need to make external tank conversion.  ... (as far as I know).
